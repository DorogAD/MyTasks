# IT Academy

This repository contains tasks I solved while studying a comprehensive Python/Django web development course in IT Academy, that covered the whole range of web instruments and technologies.

Each folder is a single classwork or homework task. The tasks are arranged in the same order as they were set, with no date specified.
